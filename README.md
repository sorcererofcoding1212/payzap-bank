# Payzap Bank Service

This repository contains the bank service for the Payzap platform.

The service simulates real-world banking systems by handling bank-side
operations such as credential verification, balance checks, and processing
on-ramp and off-ramp transactions.

This bank service communicates with the wallet webhook service, ensuring that core application logic remains
isolated from external requests.
